# Spider
This game is ran with the main node. All the assets used are my own. 
The controls are "a" and "d" to move left and right and "w" to jump.
The spider follows you and tries to eat you, he bites you with an animation and when you are bit, blood particles shoot out.
There is a heart item that when touched, increases the health of the player. It emits idle particles and also an explosive particle when it is grabbed.
